## How it works

Awesome Tracker captures user navigation through your WordPress site on server-side, before serving the page. It allows you to know exactly what pages were served to what users of your WordPress site and when.

Apart from tracking user navigation on your site, it allows you to configure API endpoints that should be tracked as well. This is especially useful for headless WordPress installations.

## How to use

From your WordPress administration panel go to `Plugins > Installed Plugins` and scroll down until you find `Awesome Tracker`. You will need to activate it first. Once activated, a new admin menu item called `Awesome Tracker` will appear.

### API Routes Configuration

In the `Awesome Tracker > API Routes` menu you can set the API calls you want to track.

### View Tracked Records

In the `Awesome Tracker > Tracked Records` menu you can view, filter and download the list of tracked records.
